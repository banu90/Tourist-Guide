                <h3> Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than than the Taj<br>Mahal?</h3><br>
                <p>Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.</p><br>
                <p>At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than<br>building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing<br>its magnificence up close.<br><br></p>
                <p>After all, this is art. Built in Agra, <span>India</span> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s<br> the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj<br>Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from <br>Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.</p><br>
                <p>Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), <br>and so much more…</p><br>

                <h3>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
                <p>That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.<br></p>
                <p>Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian<br> men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.</p><br>
                <p>To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour.<br> Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from <span>8-day Golden Triangle tours</span> (now with solo-only <br>departures!) to 15-day trips dedicated to food, to 19-day trips combining the highlights of India<br> and Nepal.</p><br>
                <p>If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from<br> Delhi. Check out <span>Urban Adventures</span> to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this. And while<br> you’re at it, check out their day trips in Delhi, Jaipur, <span>Varanasi</span> and <span>Mumbai!</p><br>

                <p>The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally<br>
                 prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…
                </p><br>
                <h3>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h3><b><br>
                <p>Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have<br>
                minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.</p>
                <p>You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:</p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passport</li>
                    <li>Money</li>
                    <li>Water</li>
                    <li>Medicine</li>
                    <li>Camera</li>
                    <li>Phone</li>
                </ul><br>
            </div>
            <div class="sec-4">
                    <h3>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
                    <p>There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will<br> need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.</p><br>
                    <p>It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear<br> sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.</p><br>
                    <p>If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid <br>the worst of the heat.</p><br>

                        <p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p><br>
                        <p>Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are<br> easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are <br>to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of<br> laces are hard!</p><br>
                    </div> 
                    <div class="sec-6">
                        <h4>Other things you need to know</h4><br>
                            <p>No food is allowed inside.</p><br>
                            <p>Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.</p><br>
                            <p>Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with.<br>Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small<br> video cameras) are not allowed.</p><br>
                            <p>Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your <br>wits about you and you won’t need to worry!</p><br>

                        <h3>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
                        <p>Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if <br>possible).</p><br>                                        
                    </div>
                    <section class="main-sec-3">
                        <img src="image2.png" alt="pict-5"><br><br>
                        <div class="sec-8">
                            <p> If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an<br>amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw<br> to take you there and back cheaply.)</p><br>                      
                        <p>And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly <br>(or more!) remain in awe of it. Sana Jinah, one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has <br>some tips on how to do this:</p><br>
                        <p>The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So, once I’m <br>done briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try to<br> make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I say what they are then<br> they will no longer be surprises!<br>
                            The Taj has such a charm. Every time I see it it looks different (due to the direction of the<br> sunlight). It’s so beautiful…</p><br>
                        <p>She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise<br> on a clear day.</p><br>

                            <h3>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
                            <p>Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit <br>on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.</p><br>

                            <p>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth<br> seeking out.</p><br>
                            <p>Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, Pravin <br>Tamang. (His photography is amazing – check it out!)</p><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li>
                                <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main<br> platform</li>
                                <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
                                <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
                                <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li>                                
                            </ul><br>
                            <p>You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. <br>Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the<br> day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!</p><br>

                            <h3>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h3><br>
                            <p>First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then <br>explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:</p><br>
                            <h4>What to do in Agra</h4><br>
                            <p>The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort is<br> also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century <br> Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.</p><br>
                            <p>Despite being located on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in<br> many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you<br> likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.</p><br>                            
                            <p>One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by<br> (sometimes) taking travelers to Sheroes Hangout. Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe <br>run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their<br> stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.</p><br>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Where to go outside of Agra</h3><br>
                            <p>There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these,<br> Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.</p><br>
                            <p>Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back <br>and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit<br> it on this 15-day trip from Delhi to Kathmandu (cooking demo and palace visit included!).</p><br>

                            <h6>Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</h6><br>
                            <p>Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the ‘Pink City’, the capital of Rajasthan is full of<br> chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting<br> bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.</p><br>
                            <p>Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home<br> to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy <br>nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on this 15-day trip all around <br>Rajasthan.</p><br>
                            <h3>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h3><br>
                            <p>As you may have read or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough <br>clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.</p><br>
                            <p>Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white <br>surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work – <br>applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried<br> out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects<br> carried out on the historic site.</p><br>
